    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>V.&mdash;THE DUFFER AT CRICKET.</h3>

    <p>To hear my remarks on the Cricket, in the Pavilion, you
    might think that I had been a great player entirely, in my day.
    "Who is that fine old English sportsman," you might ask, "who
    seems to have been so intimate with MYNN, and FULLER PILCH, and
    CARPENTER, and HAYWARD and TARRANT and JACKSON and C.D.
    MARSHAM? No doubt we see in him the remains of a sterling
    Cricketer of the old school." And then when I lay down the law
    on the iniquity of boundary hits, "always ran them out in
    <i>my</i> time," and on the tame stupidity of letting balls to
    the off go unpunished, and the wickedness of dispensing with a
    long stop, you would be more and more pursuaded that I had at
    least, played for my county. Well, I <i>have</i> played for my
    county, but as the county I played for was Berwickshire, there
    is perhaps nothing to be so very proud of in that distinction.
    But this I will say for the Cricketing Duffer; he is your true
    enthusiast. When I go to Lord's on a summer day, which of my
    contemporaries do I meet there? Not the men who played for the
    University, not the KENNYS and MITCHELLS and BUTLERS, but the
    surviving members of College Second Elevens in the old days of
    Cowley Marsh, when every man brought his own bottle of Oxford
    wine for luncheon. These are the veterans who contribute most
    to the crowd of lookers-on. They never were of any use as
    players, but their hearts were in the game, and from the game
    they will never be divorced. It is an ill thing for an outsider
    to drop a remark about Cricket among us, at about eleven
    o'clock in a country house smoking-room. After that the time
    flies in a paradise of reminiscences, till about 4 A.M. or some
    such "wee, short hour ayont the Twal'," if one may quote BURNS
    without being insulted by all the numerous and capable wits of
    Glasgow. Why is it that the Duffer keeps up his interest in
    Cricket, while the good players cease to care much about it?
    Perhaps <i>their</i> interest was selfish; his is purely ideal,
    and consequently immortal. To him Cricket was ever an
    unembodied joy of which he could make nothing palpable; nothing
    subject to the cold law of averages. Mine was 0.3.</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/97.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>My own introduction to Cricket, as to Golf, was peculiarly
    poignant. I and my brother, aged more or less about six or
    seven, were invited to play by the local Club, and we each
    received exactly one very slow and considerate lob. But his lob
    took him on the eye, and mine, kicking on a bad wicket, had me
    on the knee-pan. The subsequent proceedings did not interest us
    very much, but there is nothing like entering children early at
    a manly pastime.</p>

    <p>Intellectual application will, to some extent, overcome
    physical difficulties. By working at least five hours a day,
    and by reading the <i>Cricket Field</i> daily and nightly, I
    did learn to bowl a little, with a kind of twist. This, while
    it lasted, in a bowlerless country, was a delightful
    accomplishment. You got into much better sporting society than
    you deserved, and, in remote parts of the pastoral districts
    you were looked up to as one whose name had been in <i>Bell's
    Life</i>; we still had <i>Bell's Life</i> then. It was no very
    difficult matter to bowl a rustic team for a score of runs or
    so, and all went merry as a wedding bell. But, alas, when
    Drumthwacket played Tullochgorum, there was a young Cambridge
    man staying with the latter chieftain. I began, as I usually
    did, by "yorking" Tullochgorum's Piper and his chief Butler,
    and his head Stalker, and then SMITH of King's came in. The
    ground, as usual, had four sides. He hit me over the enclosure
    at each of the four sides, for I changed my end after being
    knocked for five fours in his first over. After that, my
    prestige was gone. The rustics, instead of crawling about their
    wickets, took to walking in and smacking me. This would not
    have mattered, if any of the Drumthwacket team could have held
    a catch, and if the wicket-keeper had not let SMITH off four
    times in one over. My character was lost, and all was ended
    with me north of the Grampians, where the wickets are
    peculiarly suitable to my style of delivery.</p>

    <p>As to batting, there is little that is pleasant to confess.
    As soon as I got a distant view of a ball, I was ever tempted
    to whack wildly in its direction. There was no use in waiting
    for it, the more I looked at it the less I liked it. So I
    whacked, and, if you always do this, a ball will sometimes land
    on the driving part of the bat, and then it usually happened
    that my companion, striving for a five or a six, ran me out. If
    he did not, I did not stay long. The wicket-keeper was a person
    whose existence I always treated as <i>une quantité
    négligeable</i>, and sometimes the ball would bound off his
    pads into the stumps. The fielders would occasionally hold a
    catch, anything <i>may</i> happen. On the other hand there was
    this to be said for my style of batting, that the most
    experienced Cricketer could not tell where or in what direction
    I would hit any given ball. If it was on the off, that was no
    reason why I should not bang it to square-leg, a stroke which
    has become fashionable since my time, but in those old days,
    you did not often see it in first-class Cricket. It was rather
    regarded as "an agrarian outrage." Foreigners and ladies would
    find Cricket a more buoyant diversion if all the world, and
    especially LEWIS HALL and SHREWSBURY, played on my principles.
    Innings would not last so long. Not so many matches would be
    drawn. The fielders would not catch cold.</p>

    <p>To speak of fielding is to revive unspeakable sorrows. For a
    short-sighted man, whose fingers are thumbs, no post in the
    field is exactly grateful. I have been at long-leg, and,
    watching the game intently, have perceived the batters running,
    and have heard cries of "well fielded!" These cries were
    ironical. The ball had been hit past me, but I was not
    fortunate enough to observe the circumstance. A fielder of this
    <i>calibre</i> always ends by finding his way to short-leg. A
    prudent man can do a good deal here by watching the umpire,
    dodging when he dodges, and getting behind him on occasion. But
    I was not prudent. I observed that a certain player hit very
    much behind the leg, so there, "in the mad pride of
    intellectuality," I privily stationed myself. He <i>did</i> it
    very fine, very fine indeed, into my eye. The same misfortune
    has attended me at short-slip; it should have been a wicket, it
    was a black eye, or the loss of a tooth or two, as might
    happen. In fact, I sometimes wonder myself at the contemptuous
    frankness of my own remarks on the fielding at Lord's. For if a
    catch could be missed (and most catches can), I was the man to
    miss it. Swift ones used to hit me and hurt me, long ones I
    always misjudged, little simple poppy ones spun out of my
    fingers. Now the unlucky thing about Cricket, for a Duffer, is
    that your misfortunes do not hurt yourself alone. It is not as
    in a single at Golf, it is not as in fishing, or riding, or
    wherever you have no partner. To drop catches is to madden the
    bowler not unnaturally, and to lengthen the period of
    leather-hunting. Cricket is a social game, and its proficients
    soon give the cold shoulder to the Duffer. He has his place,
    however, in the nature of things. It is he who keeps up the
    enthusiasm, who remembers every run that anybody I made in any
    given match. In fact, at Cricket, the Duffer's mission is to be
    a "judge of the game;" I don't mean an Umpire, very far from
    that. If you once let the Duffer umpire he could ruin the
    stoutest side, and secure victory to the feeblest. I may say
    that, at least in this capacity, I have proved really useful to
    my party in country matches. But, in the long run, my capacity
    even for umpiring came to be doubted, and now I am only a
    critic of Cricket. There is none more relentless, not one with
    a higher standard, at least where no personal feelings are
    concerned. For I have remarked that, if a Cambridge man writes
    about an Oxford victory (which he seldom has to do), or if an
    Oxford man writes on a Cambridge victory (a frequent
    affliction), he always leaves you with the impression that, in
    spite of figures, his side had at least a moral triumph. These
    admirable writers have all been Duffers.</p>

    <h4>(<i>A Sketch at the Collection of Instruments of
    Torture.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Maddox Street Galleries. A large and
        appropriately lighted room. Upon walls of a sombre crimson,
        various Implements of Torture are arranged with
        considerable taste, and an eye for decorative effect, the
        central space being reserved for more elaborate
        contrivances in wood and iron. Visitors discovered
        inspecting the Exhibition by the aid of the excellent
        Catalogues, with the subdued appreciation of persons
        conscious that they are spending a very pleasant and
        profitable afternoon.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Mr. Charnelhouse Goole</i> (<i>as he enters, to</i> Mrs.
    C.G.). Now, my dear, the first thing I want to see is that Iron
    Maiden there's so much talk about. I wonder whereabouts it
    is!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. C.G.</i> I think <i>that</i> must be it, up at the
    other end of the room. But don't you <i>think</i>, dear, it
    would be nicer to see the <i>other</i> things first, and keep
    that for the <i>last</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.G.</i> (<i>struck by the refinement of this
    suggestion</i>). Well, upon, my word, AMINA, I almost think it
    would!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Frederic Frivell</i> (<i>to his wife, whom he takes a
    marital pleasure in shocking</i>). What fun those old fellows
    must have had in those days, mustn't they?</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Frivell</i> (<i>a serious lady</i>). I don't think
    fun is at <i>all</i> the right word, FREDERIC. I do <i>wish</i>
    you wouldn't take these things so lightly. I'm sure it's
    melancholy enough to look at all these horrid machines, and
    think&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> That Torture is a lost art? Isn't that what
    you were going to say? But it's <i>not</i>, you know; we've
    refined it&mdash;that's all. Look at the Photographer, and the
    Interviewer, and the Pathetic Reciter, and the&mdash;</p>

        mean that at all, and that he is comparing totally
        different things.</i></p>

    <p><i>An Aphoristic Uncle</i> (<i>to an irreverent Nephew</i>).
    No. 89. "A Long-spiked Wooden Roller, known as a 'Spiked
    Hare.'" You see, TOM, my boy, the victim
    was&mdash;(<i>Describes the process.</i>) "Some of the old
    writers describe this torture as being most fearful," so the
    Catalogue tells us.</p>

    <p><i>Tom-my-boy</i> (<i>after inspecting the spikes</i>).
    Well, do you know, Uncle, I shouldn't be at all surprised if
    the old Johnnies weren't so far out.</p>

    <p><i>The Aph. Uncle.</i> Another illustration, my boy, of
    "Man's inhumanity to Man"!</p>

    <p><i>Tom-my-boy.</i> Not bad for you, Uncle&mdash;only you
    cribbed it out of the Catalogue, you know! [<i>The A.U. gives
    him up.</i></p>

        <p><i>An</i> Indulgent Parent <i>enters, leading a small
        boy in a tall hat, and is presently recognised by the</i>
        A.U.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The A.U.</i> So you've brought your son to see this
    collection, hey? Well, it's of the greatest educational value
    to a thoughtful youth&mdash;rich in moral and historical
    instruction!</p>

    <p><i>The I.P.</i> Well, it was like this, you see. I had to
    take him to the dentist's, and, finding we should have
    half-an-hour or so to spare before he could attend to him, I
    thought we'd just drop in here and amuse ourselves&mdash;eh,
    BOBBY? Wonderfully ingenious, you know, in their way, some of
    these things! Now, <i>here's</i> a thing&mdash;"A Spanish
    mouth-pear, made of iron." You see, BOBBY, they forced it into
    the mouth and touched a screw, and it sprang open, preventing
    the victim from screaming.</p>

    <p><i>Bobby</i>. Y-yes, father. Should you think Mr. Fawcepps
    will have one of those?</p>

    <p><i>The I.P.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Now, what <i>is</i> the
    use of my taking you to a place of this sort to divert your
    thoughts, if your mind is running on something else all the
    time? I won't have it, do you hear. Enjoy yourself like a
    sensible boy!</p>

    <p><i>Bobby</i>. Y-yes, Father, I am. It&mdash;it's quite cured
    my toothache already&mdash;<i>really</i> it has!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Frivell</i> (<i>reading from Catalogue</i>). "A
    Penitent's Girdle, made of barbed wire, which, when worn next
    to the flesh, caused the most unpleasant and uncomfortable
    irritation." Oh, FREDERIC, just fancy that!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> My dear CECILIA, I can <i>quite</i> fancy
    it!</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> But I thought these tortures were only for
    <i>Malefactors</i>. Why do they call it a <i>Penitent's</i>
    Girdle?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. F.</i> Can't say,&mdash;unless because he generally
    repented having put it on.</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. F.</i> I don't think that <i>can</i> be the real
    reason.</p>

    <p><i>Two English House-maids</i> (<i>to a small German
    Page-Boy who is escorting them</i>). Here, JOHNNIE, what's
    <i>this</i> mean? (<i>Reads from Catalogue the motto on an
    Executioner's Sword.</i>) "Di Herrin' sturin dem Unheel ick
    exequire ir End Urthile." Come, <i>you</i> ought to know!</p>

    <p><i>Johnnie</i> (<i>not unnaturally at a loss</i>). It
    means&mdash;it means&mdash;somding I do not understandt.</p>

    <p><i>The Housemaids</i> (<i>disappointed in him</i>). Well,
    you <i>are</i> a boy! I <i>did</i> think, bein' German
    yourself, you'd be quite at <i>'ome</i> 'ere!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Ernest Stodgely</i> (<i>impressively, to</i> Miss
    FEATHERHEAD, <i>his fiancée</i>). Just look at this, FLOSSIE.
    (<i>Reading.</i>) "Executioner's Cloak, very long, of red
    woollen material; presumably red so as not to show blood-spots
    or stains." Hideously suggestive that, is it not?</p>

    <p><i>Miss Flossie.</i> I shouldn't call it exactly
    <i>hideous</i>, ERNEST. Do you know, I was just thinking that,
    with a high Astrachan collar, you know, and old silver
    fastenings, it would make rather a nice winter cloak. So
    deliciously warm! [ERNEST <i>avails himself of a lover's

    <p><i>Mr. Ch. Goole.</i> So <i>this</i> is the Iron Maiden!

    three to five every afternoon. Draw all London!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February 15.</i>&mdash;A lively
    sitting, with an unexpected ending. Debate on Address resumed
    by SEXTON in excellent speech, an effect largely contributed to
    by comparative brevity. Only an hour long; remarkable
    compression. Would have been better still had it been reduced
    by the twenty minutes occupied in preliminary observations. At
    twenty-five minutes past four he rose to move Amendment
    condemnatory of Land Purchase Act of last year. Precisely at a
    quarter to five came to his amendment, and began to recommend
    it to House. But mustn't complain. An excellent beginning for
    new Session that may further develop.</p>

    <p>"An oratorical eel," SAUNDERSON, later in sitting, likened
    Member for West Belfast to; charming simile, with just that
    mixture of graphicness and incongruity that only Irish wit
    could flash upon. Not meant to be uncomplimentary, for
    SAUNDERSON, like the rest, acknowledges capacity of SEXTON in
    debate; his clear insight, his capacity for grasping a subject,
    his aptness of illustration, his quickness of retort, and,
    alack! the embarrassment of the wealth of language. If he could
    only economise that, and guard against the fatal fluency that
    besets him, converting what might be a sharp direct speech of
    twenty minutes into a windy weariness of hour-and-a-half or two
    hours, he would take high rank among Parliamentary
    debaters.</p>

    <p>DIZZY once said the occasions when a man addressing House of
    Commons need exceed twenty minutes, come to him only twice or
    thrice in a lifetime. He did more than preach; he carried into
    practice his own principle with success. Very rarely in later
    years, even when Leader of House of Commons, did he exceed
    twenty minutes, and all his most successful interpositions in
    debate were on that plan. When, occasionally, he felt that
    circumstances demanded a long and laboured address, his labour
    was in vain.</p>

    <p>Capital speech, too, of quite another kind, from DUNBAR
    BARTON. Most promising maiden speech delivered in present
    Parliament; of good omen that best parts were not those
    prepared in leisure of study, put the earlier passages evoked
    by preceding debate, and necessarily impromptu. As for
    SAUNDERSON, he was in his best form.</p>

    <p>"SAUNDERSON," said the SQUIRE OF MALWOOD, recognising a
    kindred spirit, "always reminds me of those Lifeguardsmen you
    see at the Military Festival, riding round Agricultural Hall
    slashing off heads. The heads are dummies, and no harm is done;
    but it's a pretty sight."</p>

    <p>The Colonel rides well, and is a skilful swordsman.</p>

    <p>Delight of audience crowding in after dinner completed by
    TIM HEALY dashing in with intent to trip up Colonel. Domestic
    difficulties in the Party have not smoothed down TIM's natural
    truculence. With JOHN REDMOND sitting behind him and SAUNDERSON
    in front, a porcupine in fretful mood is a ball of spun silk
    compared with TIM.</p>

    <p>After this RADCLIFFE COOKE and collapse, with the prospect
    of proceedings droning on till midnight, then adjournment, and
    begin again to-morrow. Suddenly, on stroke of twelve, Closure
    moved. House completely taken aback. Whilst it sat gasping
    under shock SPEAKER declared Closure carried; bells rang
    through all the corridors; Members trooped in to find Division
    imminent. When figures declared, showing Government had been
    surprised into narrow majority of 21, fresh wave of excitement
    welled forth, amid which Address was, somehow, agreed to.
    Members went off into snowstorm, cheering and laughing as if
    there had never before been such larks.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Address agreed to.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday Night</i>.&mdash;GRANDOLPH turned up to-day; took
    his familiar corner seat; tugged at his old moustache; caressed
    his new beard, and listened to SEALE HAYNE recklessly attacking
    the sacred institution of Justiciary of the Peace.</p>

    <p>"Nothing changed, TOBY, dear boy," he said; "not even the
    Ministry. When I came back from Mashonaland I was told we were
    on the eve of political earthquake. The House of Commons was to
    be transformed into a cockpit; the Benches steepled in the gore
    of an iniquitous Ministry. But, except for some vacant places
    and some further advancement of privates in the little band I
    once officered, it's all the same, only a little drearier. The
    same throng in the Lobby, the same rows of Members sitting on
    the Benches, the same Mace on the Table, the same stately
    figure in the Chair, and the same Sergeants-at-Arms relieving
    guard at the Cross Benches. There are not quite the same two
    Irish Leaders, for BRER FOX has 'gone away.' BRER RABBIT I see
    sitting over there with his kindly face and his friendly smile,
    perhaps the only Irishman in the House who, if a coat were
    trailed before him, would turn away from temptation. It's only
    Irishmen, with their inexhaustible fund of humour, who would
    have put JUSTIN MCCARTHY in his present place. Doesn't much
    matter so long as TIM HEALY's around. I'll bet my gold mine at
    Mashonaland against the Kennel, Barks, that TIM will make up
    the average of fighting even when BRER RABBIT in the
    scale."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"

    <p>There's one thing changed GRANDOLPH did not allude to;
    perhaps unconscious of it. 'Tis his own appearance. In addition
    to the beard, he has put on ruddy tint that speaks well for
    Mashonaland as a health resort compared with Westminster.
    Amongst the pale-faced legislators his visage shines like the
    morning sun. "Quite a Colonial look about him," says ALGERNON
    BORTHWICK, fretfully. "But, after a few dinners at the
    Amphitryon and a few nights at the House and elsewhere, he'll
    get over it."</p>

    <p>Members from all parts crowd round GRANDOLPH to shake the
    horny hand of the intrepid explorer, the dauntless lion
    <i>dompter</i>. A cold air whistles along the row of Ministers
    as he sits behind.</p>

    <p>"What's he up to?" JOKIM hoarsely whispered, all his native
    gaiety eclipsed.</p>

    congratulate us on our great victory last night, whereby we
    escaped defeat in Debate on Address by triumphant majority of
    21."</p>

    <p>"Quite a stormy petrel don't you think?" JOKIM said,
    nervously rubbing his hands.</p>

    <p>"Not exactly," said Prince ARTHUR; "that usually comes
    before the storm you know. If you must be personal and
    ornithological, I should say GRANDOLPH's appearance on the
    scene is more reminiscent of the vulture; a little hasty in his
    appearance perhaps, but that is none the less significant."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Practically none, and so home to
    dinner at twenty minutes to eight.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;Prince ARTHUR explained
    provisions of long-looked-for Local Government scheme. A
    remarkable, unexampled, scene. House crowded on every Bench,
    with Duke of DEVONSHIRE looking down from Peers' Gallery,
    thanking Heaven he is out of it. Prince ARTHUR's manner in
    introducing the measure in keeping with the strange
    surroundings. Might reasonably have been expected that he would
    have been at pains to recommend the Bill to acceptance of
    House. Not a bit of it. If people insisted upon regarding it as
    the most important business of Session, Prince ARTHUR couldn't
    help it. But he certainly would not foster the delusion. In its
    potentiality of beneficent effect, the Bill nothing in
    comparison with the Coercion Act or the Light Railways Act.</p>

    <p>"A poor thing," he said, in effect, and did not add, "but
    mine own."</p>

    <p>If it was not his, certainly no one else would own it. Irish
    Members received it with jeers. JOHN MORLEY denounced it as a
    monstrous imposture. SQUIRE OF MALWOOD benignantly affected to
    regard it as a little joke with which Ministers designed to
    vary a dull Session. But a joke may be carried too far; better
    drop this now, and go to business.</p>

    <p>Oddly enough, the storm of contumely had effect of inspiring
    Prince ARTHUR with new affection for his unwelcomed offspring,
    adding to the strength of his evidently new conviction that the
    proposed expedient was sound, and, if accepted, would prove
    efficacious.</p>

    <p>"And what do <i>you</i> think of the Tory scheme of Home
    Rule," I asked JUSTIN MCCARTHY, when it was all over.</p>

    <p>"<i>Timeo Danaos, et dona ferentes</i>," he said, dropping
    into his native Celtic speech. "But in this case there is no
    room for apprehension. BALFOUR may leave this wooden horse
    outside the gates for a month, and the Trojans wouldn't touch
    it with a pair of tongs."</p>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR grew more confident as the clouds
    gathered.</p>

    <p>"I see very well," he said, "if I'm to stable this horse in
    the Home Rule Troy, I must drag it all the way myself. I shall
    get no help from either section of the garrison. But it's got
    to be done, and I'll buckle-to. Once through, it will settle
    the more than ten years' siege."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Prince ARTHUR left tugging away
    at his wooden horse.</p>

    <p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;House of Lords almost deserted.
    HALSBURY punctual in his place, making most of opportunities on
    Woolsack whilst they yet remain.</p>

    <p>"Here to-day and gone to-morrow, TOBY," he remarked, with
    forced gaiety; "but, when I hand in the Seals of Office, I
    shall at least have the serene assurance to cheer me in my
    retirement that the whole of my family, including collateral
    branches, have been provided for."</p>

    <p>Amongst the prevailing dolour, the MARKISS in high
    spirits.</p>

    <p>"Things not looking well in the Commons or the country, I
    admit," he says; "but all is not lost yet. I have still a card
    to play, and I believe it will score the trick. We shall
    presently have to go to the country, and fight a confident
    Opposition. Successful Foreign Policy is played out. Free
    Education has brought us no support; trifling with Home Rule in
    Ireland will bring us enemies. Am convinced that the thing to
    go to the country on is the fog. MIDDLETON's our man. Been
    thinking over it for a week. See it now; shall take up question
    of London fog; devise some means of battling with it; and then
    let the worst come. A Government that has fought the fog will
    at least carry London, and, London ours, we shall be able to
    stem the tide of anarchy."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;The MARKISS takes a great
    resolution.</p>

    <h2>"VIVE LA LIBERTÉ!"</h2>

    <p>The <i>Era</i> at one time used to enjoy a monopoly of
    strangely, but purely professionally-worded advertisements; but
    now the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> is creeping up and commencing to
    occupy the <i>Era's</i> special domain. One day last week in
    the <i>D.T.</i> the following notice appeared:&mdash;"Mr.
    CHARLES SUGDEN at liberty.&mdash;Address, &amp;c." "At
    Liberty!" How will this sound to the uninitiated millions?
    Taking for granted that the readers, whose name is Legion, know
    perfectly well who and what Mr. CHARLES SUGDEN is, having a
    lively recollection of this talented actor as among the best
    representatives of bad characters (excepting perhaps that of
    <i>William of Orange</i>, which was Mr. SUGDEN's <i>chef
    d'oeuvre</i>, and about whose character there are strong
    differences of opinion), will they not unnaturally be led to
    inquire how, why, when and wherefore Mr. SUGDEN ever came to be
    deprived of his liberty, and under what circumstances he has
    been restored to it, or it to him? "At Liberty!" It has a grand
    and glorious sound! This distinguished Thespian was never an
    "hereditary bondsman," then why not always "at liberty"? But,
    be this as it may, once more "the Rover is free!" SUGDEN is a
    name honourable behind and before the foot-lights. In the
    Courts of Law it is a Legal Light, and among Gas Companies the
    Sugden Burner is, we believe, justly famous. Whatever the
    announcement may or may not mean, all sons of Liberty will
    rejoice that this eccentric comedian is once more free, and on
    the stage he will be again most welcome.</p>

    <h3>ON RELIGIOUS CYMBALISM.</h3>

    <p>The Salvationist Bands which perform in and out of
    London&mdash;(would that they were restricted as the Moore and
    Burgess Minstrels restrict themselves to one hall, never or
    "hardly ever," performing out of London!)&mdash;everywhere and
    anywhere without respecting illness, or the hours of public
    worship in our Churches and Chapels, or the necessities of
    repose, show thereby a distinct want of that consideration for
    the feelings of their fellow-citizens which simple Christian
    folk call Charity. These Booth performers&mdash;which
    designation savours suggestively of Mountebanks&mdash;would do
    well to play their peculiar music and sing their peculiar hymns
    within the four walls of their own places of worship, employing
    the intervals essential for gaining of wind and for rest of
    muscle in meditating, perhaps breathlessly, on the inspired
    Pauline teaching which will inform them that even the works of
    an Apostle, if he have not charity, will be as "sounding brass
    and tinkling cymbals," making indeed a great noise in the
    world, but as one WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE has said, being mere
    "sound and fury signifying nothing." "Liberty of Worship" by
    all means, but not such Liberty for any one particular form of
    worship which, interfering with the freedom of others, speedily
    degenerates into fanatical licence, and so becomes a nuisance
    as intolerant as it is intolerable.</p>

    <p>ANGLO-AMERICAN FRENCH.&mdash;A new word must be added to our

    article on HECTOR MALOT, occurs this expression, "<i>en ce
    temps de puffisme littéraire</i>." In English we have had the
    word and the thing too, since the time of SHERIDAN's
    <i>Critic</i>, but is any student of French journalism familiar
    with it in the Parisian newspapers?</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>In <i>Tess of the D'Urbevilles</i> (published by Messrs.
    OSGOOD, MCILVAINE &amp; CO.), Mr. THOMAS HARDY has given us a
    striking work of fiction, bold in design, and elaborate in
    finish. The characters, with one exception, are as true to life
    as are his graphic descriptions of nature's own scenery; true
    that is to the types of such rural life as he professes to
    represent,&mdash;the life led in our Christian country by
    thousands and thousands of genuine Pagans, superstitious
    Boeotians, with whom the schoolmaster can do but little, and
    the parson still less. As to the clergymen who appear in this
    story, two of them are priggishly academic, a third is a
    comfortable antiquarian, and the fourth unacquainted with even
    the A.B.C. of his own pastoral theology.</p>

        <h4>A BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR IN THE MILKY WAY.</h4>Showing
        how an Angel without wings played on the harp to Milkmaid
        Tess of the Tubbyveals, who was so proud of her calves.
    </div>

    <p>Since THACKERAY's <i>Captain Costigan</i>, and TOM
    ROBERTSON's dramatic variation of him as <i>Eccles</i> in
    <i>Caste</i>, no more original type of the besotted, no-working
    working-man, has been given us ("at least, as far as I am
    aware," interpolates the Baron, with a possible reservation)
    than <i>Tess's</i> father, <i>Durbeyfield</i>. His foolish
    wife, <i>Joan</i>, kindly in a way, a fair housewife and
    helpmate, yet deficient in moral sense, is another
    admirably-drawn character.</p>

    <p>The only blot on this otherwise excellent work is the
    absurdly melodramatic character of that "villain of the deepest
    dye," <i>Alec D'Urbeville</i>, who would be thoroughly in his
    element in an Adelphi Drama of the most approved type, ancient
    or modern. He is just the sort of stage-scoundrel who from time
    to time seeks to take some mean advantage of a heroine in
    distress, on which occasions said heroine (of Adelphi Drama)
    will request him to "unhand her," or to "stand aside and let
    her pass;" whereupon the dastardly ruffian retaliates with a
    diabolical sneer of fiendish malice, his eyes ablaze with
    passion, as, making his melodramatic exit at the O.P. wing, he
    growls, "Aha! a day will come!" or "She must and shall be
    mine!" or, if not making his exit, but remaining in centre of
    stage to assist in forming a picture, he exclaims, with
    fiendish glee, "Now, pretty one, you are in my power!" and so
    forth. 'Tis a great pity that such a
    penny-plain-and-two-pence-coloured scoundrel should have been
    allowed so strong a part among Mr. HARDY's excellent and
    unconventional <i>dramatis personæ</i>. Even the very, very
    strong ejaculations wherein this bold bad man indulges on the
    slightest provocation belong to the most antiquated vocabulary
    of theatrical ruffianism. However, there he is, and all the
    perfumes of the Vale of Blackmoor will not suffice for
    dispelling the strong odour of the footlights which pervades
    every scene where this unconscionable scoundrel makes his
    appearance. That he is ultimately disposed of by being stuck to
    the heart with the carving-knife that had been brought in for
    cold-beef slicing at breakfast, is some satisfaction. But far
    be it from the Baron to give more than this hint in
    anticipation of the tragic <i>dénoûment</i>. Some might accuse
    Mr. THOMAS HARDY of foolhardiness in so boldly telling ugly
    truths about the Pagan Phyllises and Corydons of our dear old
    Christian England; but we, his readers, have the author's word
    for the truth of what he has written, as "the fortunes of
    <i>Tess of the D'Urbevilles, a Pure Woman</i>," are "faithfully
    presented," by THOMAS HARDY, and so his honour is pledged to
    the truth of this story which his powers of narration have made
    so fascinating to a host of readers besides the one who is a
    host in himself, namely,</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Council for the Prosecution</i> (<i>after the</i> Witness
    <i>has been sworn</i>). I think you are here on subpoena served
    by the Treasury.</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>with a glance of sadness at the
    Dock</i>). Had I not been summoned to be present by those in
    authority, not the entreaties of magicians would have brought
    me here!</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for the Pros.</i> I take it you are an unwilling
    Witness?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>with difficulty suppressing acute
    emotion</i>). A most, a very most unwilling Witness!</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for the Def.</i> (<i>scornfully</i>).
    Unwilling!</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for the Pros.</i> (<i>in a tone of
    remonstrance</i>). I really must beg my learned friend to
    refrain from disturbing the proceedings. These constant
    interruptions are most annoying.</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for the Def.</i> (<i>with force and violence</i>).
    I cannot sufficiently express my indignation&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Justice Punch</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Then do not make
    the attempt.</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for the Def.</i> (<i>surlily</i>). As your Lordship
    pleases. [<i>Subsides.</i></p>

    <p><i>Coun. for the Pros.</i> But, in spite of being an
    unwilling Witness, you undoubtedly saw the Prisoner forge your
    name?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>with his handkerchief to his eyes</i>).
    Alas! I did!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>A pause, during which everyone regains
        equanimity.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> (<i>on renewal of proceedings</i>).
    And so you are the Uncle of the Prisoner?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>sadly</i>). Yes, I am.</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> Still you are here, and are pushing
    that poor lad to the prison-door! (<i>Prisoner snivels.</i>)
    Yes, you are dealing him (one of your own flesh and blood) a
    never-to-be-recalled injury!</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>plucking up spirit</i>). Only my duty,
    Sir. I obey only my duty!</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> Your duty! Why, man, how can it be
    your duty?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Justice Punch</i> (<i>seriously</i>). Again I must
    interpose. (<i>To</i> Counsel.) Mr. MCSLANGER, I must once more
    remind you that your business at present is to ask questions,
    not to make speeches.</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> But, my Lord, the task is a difficult
    one.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Justice Punch.</i> If you find it beyond your powers,
    no doubt some of your colleagues will come willingly to your
    assistance.</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> No, my Lord, I do not mean what your
    Lordship means. I am quite capable of performing the duties it
    has been my pleasure and pride to accept.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Justice Punch</i> (<i>wearily</i>). Pray let us get
    on?</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> Do you not think it a grossly cruel
    and revolting thing that a man should give evidence against his
    near relative?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>greatly agitated</i>). My Lord, I appeal
    to you, is it fair that I should be treated in this
    fashion?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Justice Punch</i> (<i>emphatically</i>). No, it is
    not! You are here, Sir, in performance of a solemn
    duty&mdash;to assist the ends of justice in the punishment, and
    consequently prevention, of crime. It is not right that in the
    witness-box you should be badgered and insulted as if you were
    worthy of the dock! One can feel some sympathy with the
    relatives of the prisoner, because he appears to have had
    respectable surroundings. But if he is convicted of forgery, it
    will be his own fault! I shall accept the verdict as a proof
    that education and birth are not safeguards to prevent crime.
    And as for you, Sir (<i>turning angrily to</i> Coun. for Def.),
    let me tell you that you degrade your office when you make the
    wig and the gown the shield of the brute and the bully. Let us
    have no more of it!</p>

    <p><i>Coun. for Def.</i> (<i>subdued but depressed</i>). As
    your Lordship pleases.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Justice Punch.</i> It does so please me, and I think
    that it will equally please all my learned brothers who sit in
    Royal Courts to follow my example! It is time that the Witness,
    as well as the accused, received proper protection. I hope my
    words will be taken to heart in another place!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
